    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Butter Chicken also known as Chicken Makhani is a classic Indian dish that's made by simmering marinated<br>
        and grilled chicken in a spicy, aromatic, buttery and creamy tomato gravy. This lip smacking and delicious<br>
        dish is hugely popular among the Indian food lovers across the world.

    <p>
        It is believed that the Butter Chicken was invented during 1930 to 1935 at a resturant in India. The resturant<br>
        would usually have large orders of tandoori chicken but sometimes ended up with leftovers which were dry.

        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade mixture and coat them evenly. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for at<br>
            least 2 hours or overnight for better flavor absorption.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F). If you have a broiler function on your oven, use it instead of baking in this step.</li>

        <li>Bake the chicken in the preheated oven for about 20 minutes, or until they are cooked through and slightly charred. <br>

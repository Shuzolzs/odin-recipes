    <p>
        Shukto is a popular vegetable dish in Indian cuisine usually served with rice. The tradition
        of starting a meal by consuming bitters, considered to have a medicinal value, dates back to ancient
        times. Shukto was consumed as a cooling agent in the hot and humid climates of the ancient kingdoms
        of undivided Bengal like Anga, Vanga and Kalinga.
